// DIAM
// Calculates the diameter of the graph; that is, the maximum eccentricity of any vertex
// If the graph is disconnected, the diameter is taken to be infinity
// If every vertex is connected to a negative cycle, the diameter is taken to be negative infinity
// Returns the diameter in O(V^2E)
