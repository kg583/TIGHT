// VS
// Lists the vertices adjacent to the vertex abs(Ans) ordered by the current edge ordering
// If the graph is directed and Ans > 0, the listed vertices are children of Ans
// If the graph is directed and Ans < 0, the listed vertices are parents of Ans
// Returns the adjacent vertices (may be none) in O(E)
