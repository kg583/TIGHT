// IS
// Lists the indices of the edges incident to the vertex abs(Ans) ordered by the current edge ordering
// If the graph is directed and Ans > 0, the listed edge indices correspond to the outgoing edges
// If the graph is directed and Ans < 0, the listed edge indices correspond to the incoming edges
// Returns the incident edge indices (may be none) in O(E)
