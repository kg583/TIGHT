// LAPM
// Computes the Laplacian matrix of the graph in [J] deformed by Ans
// Additionally calculates the adjacency and degree matrices of the graph in [A] and [D] respectively
// Returns [J] in O(V^2 + VE), does nothing if the graph contains more than 20 vertices

If V<=20:Then
  Ans->Z
  prgmthetaGTADJM

  dim([A]:identity(max(Ans
